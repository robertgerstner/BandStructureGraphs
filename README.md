In this project, I study how graphical representations can be used for unit cells of one-dimensional periodic materials of arbitrary structure.

The atoms of the unit cell are represented as nodes in the graph and the tunneling connections (amplitudes) are represented by edges (weights).

We present algorithms for computing the band structure and fermi level given an input graph representing a unit cell.

function_library holds the relevant functions for the project, and experiments.py shows example usages with results summarized in Project_Report.

For more information, see Project_Report.pdf.
